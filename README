When I build my image with:

docker build -t my_python_image .

and then use docker run as follows:

docker run -p 8888:8888 my_python_image

The version of numpy in the container does not match the version I specified in the environment.yml

I suspect the issue is that the right environment isn't being activated - but I think I've done that with the SHELL line in the Dockerfile...
